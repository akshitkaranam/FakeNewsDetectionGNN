There are 5 ipynb notebooks that are we are submitting

1. Best_model_Politifact_default_split (splits the politifact dataset into 20:10:70) 
2. Best_model_Politifact_custom_split (splits the politifact dataset into 70:10:20)
3. Best_model_gossipcop (Only 1 model is used for this, with a default slpit of 20:10:70)
4. Politifact_Bert (Investigating the usage of ‘bert’ feature vector)
5. Politifact_Content (Investigating the usage of ‘content’ feature vector)

Notebooks 1,2 and 3 are used for the main models. These notebooks contain the results as reported in the report. 

Notebooks 4 and 5 see the differences between using the ‘bert’ feature vector and ‘content’ feature vector.
